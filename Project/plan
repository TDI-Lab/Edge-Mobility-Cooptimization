Steps:
1. Provide the vehicle mobility datasets in the input directory, one including the basic mobility and one including the balanced mobility.
	The dataset must be for only the area we consider in our simulator
	The coordinates must be in the form of Cartesian not Geo-location
	The format: timestep (second), angle, xCoordinate, yCoodrinate, speed
2: Create City and all devices including AP, Core routers, Fog nodes (cloudlet), Cloud, Vehicles, Brokers (End of August)
3. Configure the network topology and connections (one week)
4. Create agents and connection to fog nodes (one week)
5. Create workload, distribute the load on the vehicles (one week)
6. Create service placement strategy + normalization: (1 month or more)
	Local cost
	Global cost
7. Starts the simulation (1 week)
8. Evaluation (1 month)

Overall time: at least 3 months + mobility preparation + server installation + other basic algorithms (Edgeward/FirstFit)+ basic/balanced algorithm
