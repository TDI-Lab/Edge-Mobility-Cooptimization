    //Creating a seamless environment for the AR user—merging the real world and 
    //virtual world without significant latency – requires a video frame rate of 20-30 
    //frames per second (fps). This requirements means that the AR system has 33-40ms to
    //capture, process, render and display each frame’s results to the user.

    //Each vehicle sends captured images continuously to the nearest ES or cloud at 30 fps.
